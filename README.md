# Moodcast

### Project Description
Why check the weather when your face already knows how you're feeling? Our site uses facial detection to forecast your indoor vibes — complete with snark, mood-based weather, and zero actual data

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, you're feeling sad, and the weather outside is sunny and mocking you. Other times, you're euphoric but your screen background is stuck in a dark mode rut. What if your digital environment matched your emotional environment?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Moodcast uses your face and mood as inputs and displays a matching weather scene as output. Are you sleepy? You’ll get a dreamy moonlit sky. Feeling fiery? A lightning storm will set the tone. We bring the mood weathercast straight to your screen—whether you asked for it or not.
