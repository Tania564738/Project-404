# Moodcast

### Project Description
Moodcast is your emotionally intelligent weather buddy! Using face detection and emotion recognition from your webcam, Moodcast changes the virtual “weather” of your screen based on how you feel—because sometimes it just needs to rain when you're sad (or show rainbows when you're joyful).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes, you're feeling sad, and the weather outside is sunny and mocking you. Other times, you're euphoric but your screen background is stuck in a dark mode rut. What if your digital environment matched your emotional environment?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Moodcast uses your face and mood as inputs and displays a matching weather scene as output. Are you sleepy? You’ll get a dreamy moonlit sky. Feeling fiery? A lightning storm will set the tone. We bring the mood weathercast straight to your screen—whether you asked for it or not.
